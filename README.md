# 📌 Final Project – Data Analysis (Capstone)

Welcome!

This repository presents a collaborative final project in data analysis, created by both myself and [Nogatiya](https://github.com/Nogatiya).  
The work was done using **JupyterLab** and includes advanced data exploration and machine learning techniques.

## 📍 Project Overview

The notebook contains:

- 📊 Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🧠 Machine Learning model implementation  
- 📈 Evaluation of predictive results  

I personally contributed to all parts of the analysis and worked hands-on in **JupyterLab**.  
The notebook was uploaded by my teammate and is available at the following link:
